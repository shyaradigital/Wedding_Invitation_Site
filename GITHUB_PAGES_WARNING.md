# ⚠️ CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Limitations

## 🚨 Your Website Won't Work on GitHub Pages!

GitHub Pages **only serves static HTML/CSS/JS files**. Your wedding invitation website requires:

- ❌ **API Routes** (for guest verification, phone verification, device fingerprinting)
- ❌ **Database** (for storing guests, events, admin users)
- ❌ **Server-side features** (admin panel, token validation)

**These features will NOT work on GitHub Pages.**

## ✅ Better Alternative: Vercel (FREE & Works Perfectly)

**Vercel is FREE and designed for Next.js apps like yours:**

1. ✅ All features work (API routes, database, admin panel)
2. ✅ Free hosting
3. ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
4. ✅ Takes 2 minutes to set up
5. ✅ Custom domain support

**Deploy to Vercel instead:**
- See `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for instructions
- Or go to https://vercel.com and import your GitHub repo

## 📋 If You Still Want GitHub Pages

The configuration is set up, but you'll need to:

1. **Remove all API functionality**
2. **Remove database features**
3. **Convert to a static portfolio site**
4. **Remove admin panel**
5. **Remove guest verification**

This means rebuilding most of the site.

**Your site URL will be:**
`https://shyaradigital.github.io/Wedding_Invitation_Site/`

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use Vercel** - It's free, works perfectly, and your entire website will function as designed.
